# PythonNeuralNetwork

A simple neural network in python.

The code is based on the book "Make your own Neural Network" by Tariq Rashid. (Cannot recommend this book highly enough.)

The actual source code is in the python files.
    . neural_network.py - The neural network implementation
    . main.py - Instantiates, trains and tests the neural network.


The ipython notebook explains the code and the use of MNIST to train and test the NN.
